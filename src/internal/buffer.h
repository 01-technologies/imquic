 * \brief  Buffer abstraction (headers)
 * \details Abstraction of a chunked buffer, to be used either during
 * CRYPTO exchanges in the Initial/Handshake phase, or with STREAM after
 * a connection has been established. It provides a high level interface
 * to adding chunks to the queue (in a gap-aware way), and to retrieving
 * data in an ordered way (waiting in case gaps are encountered).
